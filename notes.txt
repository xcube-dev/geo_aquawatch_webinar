General:
--------

- Add DeepESDL some slides, or are they in already? -> make clear that all is executable at home via file data store 


Data stores:
------------

- explain dask cluster when writing datacubes
- explain levels -> needed for visualization
- explain chunking along time vs chunking in space: 
    - here optimized for 2D spatial visualization
    - time series will be slow
    
    
Viewer:
-------

- explain customized color maps in configuration, see SEN2L2A SCL variable
- maybe also show that color maps can be configured via UI
- show log sale of colormaps e.g. OC-CCI, I transformed it in the actual dataset, now the user can have both in the viewer
- show Time Series and Statistics, Split mode, 
- (maybe) show 2D Histogramm, to showcase a chartlets example
- User Variables, if time allows create ndvi or ndwi
